## HOME VALUES

Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI): A smoothed, seasonally adjusted measure of the typical home value and market changes across a given region and housing type. It reflects the typical value for homes in the 35th to 65th percentile range. The raw version of that mid-tier ZHVI time series is also available.

Zillow publishes top-tier ZHVI ($, typical value for homes within the 65th to 95th percentile range for a given region) and bottom-tier ZHVI ($, typical value for homes that fall within the 5th to 35th percentile range for a given region).

Zillow also publishes ZHVI for all single-family residences ($, typical value for all single-family homes in a given region), for condo/coops ($), for all homes with 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5+ bedrooms ($), and the ZHVI per square foot ($, typical value of all homes per square foot calculated by taking the estimated home value for each home in a given region and dividing it by the homeâ€™s square footage). Check out this overview of ZHVI and a deep-dive into its methodology.

## HOME VALUES FORECASTS
The Zillow Home Value Forecast (ZHVF) is the month-ahead, quarter-ahead and year-ahead forecast of the Zillow Home Values Index (ZHVI). ZHVF is created using the all homes, mid-tier cut of ZHVI and is available both raw and smoothed, seasonally adjusted.
```{r}
# Forecast All Homes - Smoothed by Zip.csv
home.val.fcst.zip <- read.csv("Forecast All Homes - Smoothed by Zip.csv")
glimpse(home.val.fcst.zip)

home.val.fcst.zip <- home.val.fcst.zip %>% 
  pivot_longer(!names(home.val.fcst.zip)[1:10],
               names_to = "Date",
               values_to = "HouseValue") %>%
  filter(State == "IA") %>%
  arrange(CountyName) %>%
  select(ID = RegionID, SizeRank, ZipCode = RegionName, 
         City, Metro, County = CountyName, BaseDate,Date, HouseValue)
