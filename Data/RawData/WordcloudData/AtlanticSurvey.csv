It has been abysmal. There aren't enough good, middle-priced, decent-sized houses in Atlantic, period. There are too many run-down and/or too-small houses. If Atlantic wants to attract families, then it needs to incentivize housing for those families. If the town only has crappy houses and rentals, it will attract exactly those people who will occupy those dwellings. Same with retirement options: if the city has an abundance of retirement dwellings, it will attract older people. So, if the city wants to maintain its school and economic core, then it MUST invest in houses that are conducive to families with children: affordable, 3-5 bedroom, structurally sound homes--either existing or newly built. The city might have to spend some money up front, to create incentives for people to build homes, but it is my conviction that the long-term economic benefit (as well as to our schools) will far outweigh the initial spending. As far as property taxes go, it is a good approach to broaden the tax base, rather than to create higher taxes on the few. So far, in Atlantic, we have the latter (high property taxes on the few) rather than the former (a broad property tax base spread out over many owners).
I'll leave the incentive schemes to the policy people, but that is the problem.","Create incentives (e.g., tax breaks) for existing home owners to improve their properties. Keep it simple.

Small cities like Atlantic are now seeing the crisis even though it’s been happening for years everywhere else. The real problem is wages in small towns do not amount to enough money to support a family and pay rent ($700-$1000). Since the rent raises have finally arrived in Atlantic people are struggling more than ever. My family specifically has 2 toddler, 3 dogs(all over age five), myself, and my husband. Our landlord two years ago wanted their son to live in the home they rented to us. We were paying $900 for large 4 bedroom home. We had never once missed a rental payment. Never once caused a problem. The landlord told us to move t first because she wanted to sell her home. We soon found out that was not the case. I had just brought my new baby home and now had to find a new place to live. We had to move by Jan. 1st of 2020. Actually we ended up moving on a week where we had two massive snow storms & no one wanted to help us move. I had no child care. It had taken us an entire year to find a place to rent. & I practically begged the individual to let us rent from them. Their home had never been rented out of. 
It was another large 5 bedroom home with another fenced in backyard. It was very outdated & no heat upstairs but we made it work. We were asked to pay $800 per month. 
In the spring we found out the roof leaked..it leaked into the attic then into my daughter room just feet away from her crib. I informed them of this & nothing was done. It was a leak we had been told had been fixed before we moved in. 
We felt with many problems in that old home. It was the absolute only option for us. Landlord never allow pets in Atlantic iowa & I had 3 dogs. We chose not to complain about a lot because we felt fortunate not to be homeless

So we were told july 31 2021 that those landlord got a cash offer on their home and we needed to begin looking for another option. Again we had never been late on payments to them. 
My husband and I were not about to go through the stress again of trying to find another rental just 6 months after we had just found this one. The last year of stressing over housing for our family just about tore our 3 year marriage apart. 

August 1st we went to a Rv dealership & began the journey of full time Rv living on a family farm. Our travel trailer payment is half of what we payed in Atlantic for rent. We can now afford necessary daily items I could not afford before. All of our income went to rent and other bills. Leaving very little to feed my family and pets. 

People who don’t make $100,000 grand a year shouldn’t be looked down upon. We shouldn’t be told we can’t have our pets. I’ve seen the other side of that argument. I know the hell the landlords go through cleaning up after pets who destroy their homes. 
But have they ever thought there may be another way? Of course people aren’t home to care for their children or their pets. They are working their lives away to pay rent to people to take it & complain about every single thing their renters do. Good or bad.

Collect information about local online news and information sources (businesses and organizations with social media presence) and encourage residents to join those that interest them. Identify businesses and organizations with existing but inactive online channels to revitalize them and cross-promote with other businesses and organizations. Encourage local businesses and organizations without online channels to develop them.

Use improved online channels to increase general interest in Atlantic (more frequent and more detailed posts about Atlantic businesses, and history, including better documentation of current events (Atlantic News Telegraph content is good, but content is often paywalled, or requires click-through that reduce engagement).

Use online communications channels to market new and existing housing-related opportunities and relevant organizations via social media channels. Many residents may not know about existing opportunities or organizations that they might be interested in becoming involved with.

Drive renovation/redevelopment of existing properties that are currently maintained in a degraded state. Atlantic has many older homes that have more character than new construction and that can offer unique housing opportunities with a connection to the history of the area at lower cost than new construction, potentially increasing the appeal of housing to potential residents.

Organize volunteer efforts (cross-promoted via developed online channels and other local volunteer pools (schools, churches, etc)) to address significant issues affecting homeowners who are unable to address the issues themselves (e.g. elderly and disabled). Example: Paint-a-thon. Community efforts to raise minimum housing standards improves quality of housing at low cost and individual connection to the community (especially when recruiting teen volunteers from the community, e.g. high school students, young people who have participated in building the community are more likely to stay in or return to the community and to work to improve it in the future).
Ensure that such events are documented for online recap (similar to Produce in the Park promotional material featuring photographs and short descriptions of recent events).

Maybe organize small investors to effect renovation/construction of rental properties to allow residents to become stakeholders without requiring them to participate in management of the enterprise or be major stakeholders. Maybe not feasible as this requires significant management and finance knowledge that could be more profitably applied elsewhere (a fundamental problem with the effort to provide housing that is both good quality and affordable; the management and organizational talent required is more likely to be applied to create high quality and high-profit housing. This is why the previous sections are aimed at increasing marketing reach, community engagement, and volunteerism. To achieve both quality and affordable housing the drive to maximize profitability must be circumvented, and this is done by increasing the desire for community. Community requires connection and awareness, thus the drive for social media reach and engagement).

There is a lack of industry which makes it difficult for people to earn enough to afford decent housing. In addition, there is a lack of affordable modern housing for young families or single people.

Paying $300,000 for a home in Atlantic, IA which has no real economic plan for growth is not a good investment, in my opinion. We have invested over $60,000 into our home in the past 5 years for both interior and exterior improvements. Our home will be updated when we go to sell, but other homes for sale right now are selling for way more and are extremely dated. There is also a huge disparity in our home and the neighbors across the street. There needs to be city ordinances/requirements for people to maintain their homes to a basic standard. It doesn’t cost you anything to keep your yard free from garbage. It doesn’t cost you money to not park your car in your yard. These are basic things that should be enforced. There is a lack of pride and laziness that is prevalent in many areas of Atlantic. ","Real estate values are completely overly inflated. We have to get industry and good paying jobs into Atlantic.

We need more restaurants and we need to clean up the main drag leading into the downtown area. There needs to be an expansion of NEW residential single family homes in a new neighborhood established take is family friendly…sidewalks…street lights…centralized park with playground equipment…etc. For existing homes that are run down in town without occupancy, there needs to be a program to purchase and “flip” the houses with a split profit between the owner of the property and the “flipper” when it’s sold.
