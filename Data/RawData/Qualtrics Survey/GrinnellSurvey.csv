If more housing is to be built, it needs to be planned with maximum GREEN SPACE in mind. E.g. houses and apartments around a large common green. Also more emphasis on green parks and safe bike paths a trails connecting them, as well as safe bike paths to schools and downtown. More needs to be done to encourage biking and walking. 
If the city could team with a graduate program in architecture - Iowa State? - it could be exciting to have grad students work directly with lower income families to design affordable housing that meets their needs and is something that the owners can take pride in. It would also provide great experience for the students involved. Similar programs have been successful in other places.

Grinnell is a high market for what you purchase. Many of the new builds lack the quality that you would expect and the price per square foot even before the current national/local rise in the market. We have focused on low income housing while neglecting quality family homes to bring more families into our community. Many of the affordable homes have been neglected in maintenance and require a great amount of work and financial investment to provide families with a quality home.,,Yes,4,5,2,3,1,Build quality/affordable single family homes,"There are many things holding our community back, and it is a complex problem deeply rooted in the community. The community’s high local market, lack of locations to build, the acceptance of the status quo of new, cheaply constructed, small footprint homes that maximize profit and minimize quality, dedication to low income, government subsidized housing that allow landlords to turn a profit but doesn’t bring young professionals  into the community, the dedication to builders in the community that are more concerned about maximizing profit than building quality long term homes, the high local market and need for readjustment from the realty industry are all variables that need to be addressed to improve our community and our housing options. This doesn’t even account fir the supply chain and the rise in material costs that have effected the industry as well. Thank you for asking this question. ","1) readjust local market to reflect the amount of work/repair current homes are in need of
2)build quality/affordable single family homes that attract young professionals
3) attract new builders/quality professionals to compete with local builders to increase the quality of our new construction
4)provide a balance of quality/affordable single family homes to match the recent efforts on low income/government subsidized housing
5)provide more diverse opportunity to purchase affordable lots locally
6)continue to work on the water/sewer issue to keep basements dry in town",Male,26 - 40,2,3,White or Caucasian,"$150,000-$199,999"
