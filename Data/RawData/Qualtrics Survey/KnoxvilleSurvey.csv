This can be determined by household income at the time of purchase among other things. Then build quality homes that are still affordable. I work in Indianola, so that’s where I see new housing developments and the homes start over $200k, which is not affordable or sustainable for the people of Knoxville, especially considering the lack of high paying jobs. People currently living in Knoxville that would like to upgrade can move into a new home (as well as people newly moving to the city) and people looking to buy more of a starter home can move into the older homes. If you incentivize both purchases people are more likely to choose Knoxville over another city. The increase in sales tax should offset some/most of the hit on property taxes. Landlords can also pass savings onto their renters. So while I emphasize from the homeowners perspective, this is a win-win for both owners and renters.
