# Data Science for the Public Good
The Data Science for the Public Good (DSPG) Young Scholars program is an immersive summer program that engages students from across Iowa to work together on projects that address local and state government challenges around critical social issues relevant in the world today. DSPG resident scholars conduct research at the intersection of statistics, computation, and the social sciences to determine how information generated within every community can be leveraged to improve quality of life and inform public policy.

# Indicators' List
# Dashboard
Our dashboard allows users to explore housing related indicators.  It is built using Tableau, and has three main pages. Each page does a different kind of analysis. The first allows the user to explore a single county, the second allows one to map an indicator and the third allows to compare two indicators.

The first page hosts a speedometer graph built with R Shiny. This graph summarizes the selected county and indicator, allowing the user to quickly understand information related to a county.

The second page displays an indicator in an Iowa county map. It allows the user to see how the selected indicator is distributed statewide.

The third page displays two indicators in a scatterplot. This analysis tool allows the user to find relationships between indicators and can also see these mapped.
