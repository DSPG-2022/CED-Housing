# Data Science for the Public Good
The Data Science for the Public Good (DSPG) Young Scholars program is an immersive summer program that engages students from across Iowa to work together on projects that address local and state government challenges around critical social issues relevant in the world today. DSPG resident scholars conduct research at the intersection of statistics, computation, and the social sciences to determine how information generated within every community can be leveraged to improve quality of life and inform public policy.

# CED Housing Project
In this project, we explored how much and what types of data are available to describe local housing markets and fill the gaps of correctly responding to housing demand. We obtained, reorganized, categorized, and analyzed data sets from a wide variety of housing-related sources, and provided a set of housing-related indicators summarized and visualized in a unified format. Additionally, we applied a set of text analysis on data from RHRA surveys to clarify housing needs prioritie of a number of communities in Iowa.
